# Cardiography

- [ECG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) (Electrocartiography)
  - Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram, a recording of the heart's electrical activity.
- [PPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram) (Photoplethysmography)
  - A photoplethysmogram is an optically obtained plethysmogram that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue.
  - A PPG is often obtained by using a pulse oximeter which illuminates the skin and measures changes in light absorption.
- [BCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistocardiography) (Ballistocardiography)
  - The ballistocardiograph is a measure of ballistic forces generated by the heart.

## BCG ([Reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6522616/))

![BCG-signal](./BCG-signal-wave.jpeg)

### Pre-systolic group
- **F wave :** (rarely seen) head-ward wave preceding G, related to pre-systolic events, not an after-vibration.
- **G wave :** small foot-ward wave which at times precedes the H wave.

### Systolic waves
- **H wave :** head-ward deflection that begins close to the peak of the R wave, maximum peak synchronously or near the start of ejection.
- **I wave :** foot-ward deflection that follows the H wave, occurs early in systole.
- **J wave :** largest head-ward wave that immediately follows the I wave, occurs late in systole.
K wave: foot-ward wave following J, occurs before the end of systole.

### Diastolic waves
- **L and N waves :** two smaller head-ward deflections which usually follow K.
- **M wave :** foot-ward deflection between L and N.
Smaller subsequent waves may be visible and are named in sequence.
